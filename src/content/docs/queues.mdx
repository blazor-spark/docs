Offloading long running tasks to the background is a great way to increase performance in you web app. Blazor Spark utilizes Coravel's [queuing](https://docs.coravel.net/Queuing/) to accomplish this.

More documentation coming soon. In the meantime, read about Coravels Queuing [here](https://docs.coravel.net/Queuing/).
