# Logging
To help you be aware of what's happening with your application, Spark provides a logging service to allow you to log messages.

Under the hood, Spark uses the [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) library.

## Configuration
Logging can be configured in your `.env` file.
```ini
LOG_CHANNEL=file
LOG_LEVEL=information
```

### Channels
Log channels control where your logs are wrote to. There are currently 2 log channels but more will be coming.
- file
- console

### Levels
Log levels control the minimum level of event that is logged to your channel. For instance, if your log level is set to `warning`, only log messages with a warning level or higher will be logged. Debug and information logs are ignored.
- debug
- information
- warning
- error
- fatal

It is recommended to set your logs to `warning` in production to avoid noise in your logs.

## Using the Logger
The Spark logger is added to the DI container for you. You simply need to inject the Spark `ILogger` service into your service or Blazor component. From there, you can write logging messages where needed.
```csharp
@page "/"
@inject ILogger logger

@code {

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        logger.Information($"Initialized at {DateTime.Now}");
    }
}
```
