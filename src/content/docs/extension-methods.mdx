## Introduction
Spark includes a variety of C# extension methods to extend base functionality.

## DbSet Extensions

### DbSet.Save()
The `DbSet.Save()` method saves a model to the database through entity framework.
```csharp
using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
db.Developers.Save(newDeveloper);
```

If the model doesn't exist in the database yet, the `Save()` method sets the `CreatedAt` property to the current datetime and creates a new record.


If the model does exist in the database, the `Save()` method sets the `UpdatedAt` property to the current datetime and updates the existing record.

### DbSet.Delete()
The `DbSet.Delete()` method deletes a model from the database.
```csharp
using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
db.Developers.Delete(developer);
```

## Navigation Manager Extensions

### NavigationManager.Route()
The `NavigationManager.Route()` method provides the route of the current page.
```razor
@page "/developers"
@inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

@code {
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var route = NavigationManager.Route();
        
        // route = "developers"
    }
}
```
