## Introduction
Blazor Spark uses EF Core models and migrations to query your data and maintain your apps database.

## Models in Spark
A model in Spark is a representation of the data in 1 database table.

Spark uses Entity Framework, so models in Spark are no different than models in Entity Framework.

The only caveat to this is the `BaseModel` class.

### BaseModel
All models in Spark extend the `BaseModel` class. The `BaseModel` class has 3 properties.
- Id
- CreatedAt
- UpdatedAt

This means you don't need to create these properties on your models, they will always be created and usable provided you are extending the `BaseModel` class.

Your models should always extend the `BaseModel` class to avoid issues with the Spark Library internal code.

## Creating a Model
To create a new model, simply run the Spark  `make model` command.

```bash
spark make model Developer
```

A new class in the `Application/Models` folder will be created.

```csharp
public class Developer : BaseModel
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public string Title { get; set; }
}
```

Then, register your model in the `DatabaseContext` class in the `Application/Database` folder:
```csharp
public class DatabaseContext : DbContext
{
    public DatabaseContext(DbContextOptions<DatabaseContext> options) : base(options)
    { }

    public virtual DbSet<Developer> Developers { set; get; }
    ...
```

## Migrations
### Create Migrations
Once your models are registered in your `DatabaseContext`, you can create a migration. This essentially acts as source control for your database schema. 

To create a new migration, simply run the Spark  `make migration` command.

```bash
spark make migration AddDeveloperTable
```

A new file with your schema changes is created in the `Application/Migrations` folder.

> ### Changing database types and migrations
> If you ever find your self in a scenario where you have created migrations and then decide to switch database types, you will need to clear your migration files out of the `Application/Migrations` folder.
>
> Then, create and run your migrations again. This is because migration files for one database type might not work for another due to different feature sets in those databases.

### Run Migrations
You can run your migration to apply the changes to your database with the Spark `migrate` command.
```bash
spark migrate
```
