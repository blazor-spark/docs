# Spark CLI

Blazor Spark provides a custom command line interface which is installed when installing the `BlazorSpark.Console` tool globally. See the [Installation page](/docs/installation) if you have not done this yet.

Most of the commands available to you are wrappers around the existing dotnet CLI commands. This makes some of the more cumbersome and clunky commands easier to remember and more elegant.

## Install
Install the Blazor Spark Templates. This must be ran 1 time before creating your first Spark project.
```bash
spark install
```

## Update
Update the Blazor Spark Templates and CLI. It's recommended to run this often as Spark is being improved constantly.
```bash
spark update
```

## Create Project
Create a Blazor Spark project. Accepts 1 parameter, the name of your application.
```bash
spark new MyApp
```

## Create Migration
Create a EF Core migration. Accepts 1 parameter, the name of your migration.
```bash
spark make:migration MyMigrationName
```

## Run Migration
Runs any outstanding migrations.
```bash
spark run:migration
```
