## Why Spark.NET?
Spark.NET is an open-source web framework that embraces ASP.NET and Entity Framework fundamentals while extending their capabilities, enabling developers to build feature-rich web applications quickly. 

Spark provides custom CLI [commands](/docs/spark-cli) to help you create new projects with ease. Currently, when creating a new project, you can choose between 2 starter templates:
- Blazor
- MVC

Every Spark project comes with a familiar folder structure, giving devs consistent architecture from project to project.

Spark projects also come with a backend library, full of features like authentication, queues, scheduled jobs and mail, to empower you to build exceptional web applications with ease without having to create these features yourself.
