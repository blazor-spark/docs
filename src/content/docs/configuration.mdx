## Introduction

Blazor Spark utilizes `.env` files to store and control most of its configurations. For example, your apps database credentials should be stored in this file, since Blazor Spark will look for them when starting the application.

This is helpful for when you have different configuration values based on the environment hte application is running in.

## Security
The `.env` file should never be committed to your apps source control. They contain sensitive information like database credentials and should be created when setting up a new environment.

The `.env.example` file acts as an example of what your `.env` file should look like. This should be commited to source control with sensitive values removed. It acts as a guide for other developers when setting up their app.

## Retrieving Environment Variables
Spark adds all environment variables to your apps configuration, just like variables in your appsettings.json. This means any variable in your `.env` can be accessed via the `IConfiguration` interface. 
```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

public class Developer(IConfiguration config)
{
    var something = config.GetValue<string>("SOME_ENV_VARIABLE");
}
```
Environment variables can also be accessed through the static `Env` class.

```csharp
using BlazorSpark.Library.Environment;

var something = Env.Get("SOME_ENV_VARIABLE");
```

## What about Appsettings?
All of the configurations for the Spark framework are pulled from the appsettings.json file.

The majority of the appsettings variables are filled in by the `.env` file. Any value in the `appsettings.json` file that starts with `ENV_` is replaced with the variable name that follows.

For example:
```json
{
    "Spark": {
        "App": {
            "Name": "ENV_APP_NAME",
            "Environment": "ENV_ENVIRONMENT"
        },
    }
```
Spark will replace the `App.Name` value with your `APP_NAME` variable in your apps `.env` file.

This makes changing variables simple between environments. You don't have to create multiple appsettings.json files. Instead, you just need to remake your `.env` file and it's values.

> If a appsettings.json variable is prefixed with `ENV_`, it is advised to not change it.

> Instead, update the corresponding variable in your `.env` file.
