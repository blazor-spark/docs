## Introduction
Events are a great way to decouple aspects of your application. For example, you may wish to send an email after a new user has registered for you app. 

You can raise an `Application/Events/UserCreated` event which a listener can receive and use to send the email.

Under the hood, Spark uses the [Coravel](https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel) library for events.

## Registering Events & Listeners
All events and listeners must be registered in the `Application/Startup/Events.cs` class.
```csharp
public static class Events
{
    public static IServiceProvider RegisterEvents(this IServiceProvider services)
    {
        IEventRegistration registration = services.ConfigureEvents();

        // add events and listeners here
        registration
            .Register<UserCreated>()
            .Subscribe<EmailNewUser>();

        return services;
    }
}
```

## Creating Events and Listeners
To create a new event and listener, simply run the Spark  `make event` command.

```bash
spark make event UserCreated EmailNewUser
```

A new event will be create in the `Application/Events` directory and a new listener will be create in the `Application/Events/Listeners` directory.

## Defining Events
Events are created in the `Application/Events` directory and must implement the `Coravel.Events.Interfaces.IEvent` interface.
```csharp
public class UserCreated : IEvent
{
    public User User { get; set; }

    public UserCreated(User user)
    {
        this.User = user;
    }
}
```

## Defining Listeners
Events are created in the `Application/Events/Listeners` directory and must implement the `Coravel.Events.Interfaces.IListener<TEvent>` interface.

The `IListener<TEvent>` interface requires you implement `HandleAsync(TEvent broadcasted)`.
```csharp
    public class EmailNewUser : IListener<UserCreated>
    {
        private readonly IMailer _mailer;
        private readonly IConfiguration _config;

        public EmailNewUser(IMailer mailer, IConfiguration config)
        {
            this._mailer = mailer;
            _config = config;
        }

        public async Task HandleAsync(UserCreated broadcasted)
        {
            var user = broadcasted.User;
            var mail = new GenericMailable()
                .To(user.Email)
                .Subject($"Welcome to Spark")
                .Html(@"
<h1>Thanks for signing up!</h1>
");
            await this._mailer.SendAsync(mail);
        }
    }
```

## Broadcasting
Inject the `Coravel.Events.Interfaces.IDispatcher` interface into your Razor components or service.

By using the `Broadcast` method, you may broadcast the event:

```razor
@page "/subscribe"
@inject IDispatcher _dispatcher

<EditForm Model="emailForm" OnValidSubmit="@HandleValidSubmit">
    <InputText @bind-Value="emailForm.Email" />
    <button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
</EditForm>

@code {
    private EmailForm emailForm = new EmailForm();

    private async Task HandleValidSubmit()
    {
        // create event
        var userCreated = new UserCreated(new User(emailForm.Email));
        // dispatch event to listener
        await _dispatcher.Broadcast(userCreated);
    }
}
```
