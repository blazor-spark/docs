# Events
Events are a great way to decouple aspects of your application. For example, you may wish to send an email after a new user has registered for you app. You can raise an `Application/Events/UserCreated` event which a listener can receive and use to send the email.

Event classes are typically stored in the `Application/Events` directory, while their listeners are stored in `Application/Events/Listeners`.

Under the hood, Spark uses the [Coravel](https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel) library for events.
