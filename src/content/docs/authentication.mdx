# Authentication
Most web applications require some form of authentication. Spark provides this out of the box with it's own custom cookie auth implementation.

## User Model
Every Spark app comes with a `User` model in the `Application\Models` directory. This acts as your schema for your users table and also the class that is used during authentication.

Users also have Roles tied to them for authorization. You can read more about that on the [Authorization page](/docs/authorization).
```csharp
public class User : BaseModel
{
    public User()
    {
        UserRoles = new HashSet<UserRole>();
    }

    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public string Email { get; set; }

    public string Password { get; set; }

    public string? RememberToken { get; set; }

    public DateTime? EmailVerifiedAt { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection<UserRole> UserRoles { get; set; }
}
```

## Scafolded Auth Pages
Spark builds the login, logout, and register pages for you. Feel free to customize their look and feel how you see fit. 

These pages aren't Blazor pages but Razor pages instead. This is because Blazor pages do not have access to the `HttpContext` methods required to authenticate.

### Login Page
Located at `Pages/Auth/Login.cshtml`

### Logout Page
Located at `Pages/Auth/Logout.cshtml`

### Register Page
Located at `Pages/Auth/Register.cshtml`

## Requiring Authentication for Blazor pages
If you have pages in your app you only want logged in users to see, use the `Authorize` attribute in your Blazor page.
```csharp
@page "/dashboard"
@attribute [Authorize]
<section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto py-28 min-h-screen px-4">
    <article>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">
            User Dashboard
        </h1>
    </article>
</section>
```
