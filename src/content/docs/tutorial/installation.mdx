## Requirements
First, verify you have installed **.NET 7**. You can find the download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).

After installing .NET 7, you will also need to install Entity Framework Core tools. This can be installed with a simple dotnet command:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

## Blazor Spark Installation
After you have installed the required dependencies, you will need to install the Spark console tool and the Blazor Spark templates.
```bash
# Install Spark CLI
dotnet tool install --global BlazorSpark.Console
# Install Spark Templates
spark install
```

## Create your Blog Project
You are now ready to create your Blazor Spark project! Lets name it MyBlog. This can be done by using the Spark CLI `spark new [projectName]` command.
```bash
spark new MyBlog
```

After the project has been created, you can create and run the migrations for the user auth tables.
```bash
cd MyBlog
spark make migration User
spark migrate
```

You can open your project in Visual Studio by running the `spark open` command.
```bash
spark open
```

For simplicity, you can use SQLite to store your application's data. This is set in your apps `.env` file under the `DB_CONNECTION` variable by default. Other options are mysql and postgres.
```ini
APP_NAME=BlazorSpark

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=Spark.db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

## Run your app
Go back to the console and start your app locally using the `dotnet watch` command. This will start the app and refresh the browser whenever changes are made to the application.
```bash
dotnet watch
```
