# Frontend
Blazor Spark utilizes Blazor components to compose it's frontend markup and logic.

Blazor components let you mix in HTML markup with C#, allowing you to quickly create dynamic components to use in your app.

```csharp
@inject DeveloperService _developerService

<ul>
    @foreach (var developer in developers)
    {
    <li>
        @developer.Name
    </li>
    }
</ul>

@code {
    private List<Developer> developers { get; set; }
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        developers = await _developerService.GetDevelopers();
    }
}
```
## Components
Blazor components are re-usable elements you can use anywhere in your application.

Your Blazor components should be created in the `./Pages/Shared` directory.

### Creating Blazor Components
To create a new Blazor component, simply run the Spark make component command.

```bash
spark make component SomeComponent
```
A new Blazor component named `SomeComponent.razor` will be created in the `./Pages/Shared` directory.

## Pages
Your Blazor pages should be created in the `./Pages` directory.

A Blazor page is a Blazor component with a `@page "/some-url"` attribute at the top that represents the url it's located at.

### Creating Blazor Pages
To create a new Blazor page, simply run the Spark make page command.

```bash
spark make page Users/Index
```

A new Blazor Page named `Index.razor` will be created in the `./Pages/Users` directory.

## Component Naming Conventions
Blazor Spark has conventions you should follow when creating your Blazor components.

### File names
Most applications have standard CRUD pages for resources.

For instance, if you app stored developers in the database, your CRUD pages should be setup like the this:
- **./Pages/Developers/Index.razor** (show all developers)
- **./Pages/Developers/Show.razor** (show 1 developer)
- **./Pages/Developers/Create.razor** (create a developer)
- **./Pages/Developers/Delete.razor** (delete 1 developer)
- **./Pages/Developers/Edit.razor** (edit 1 developer)

Blazor components files should also use **PascalCase** naming.

### Route names
When setting your `@page` attribute in a Blazor page, the following conventions should be followed:

**1.** Use lower case kebab case. Ex. `@page "/users/show-me-a-user"`

**2.** Use plural names. Ex. `@page "/users"`

**3.** CRUD routes should follow this naming convention:

A Blazor component with a path of `./Pages/Users/Index` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users"`

A Blazor component with a path of `./Pages/Users/Show` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/{id}"`

A Blazor component with a path of `./Pages/Users/Create` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/create"`

A Blazor component with a path of `./Pages/Users/Delete` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/delete/{id}"`

A Blazor component with a path of `./Pages/Users/Edit` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/edit/{id}"`

>
> If you use the Spark CLI commands to create your Pages and Components, all of the route naming conventions will automatically be setup for you.

## Assets

### CSS
Blazor Spark projects come with Tailwind CSS by default. You can learn more about Tailwind [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Javascript
Blazor Spark project come with AlpineJS by default. 

AlpineJS is a javascript library that helps you create simple page interactions like mobile menus and toggling elements.
