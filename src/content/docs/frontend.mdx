## Introduction
Blazor Spark utilizes Razor components to compose it's frontend markup and logic. Spark uses **Blazor Server** under the hood, so everything is rendered on the server.

Razor components let you mix in HTML markup with C#, allowing you to quickly create dynamic components to use in your app.

```razor
@inject DeveloperService _developerService

<ul>
    @foreach (var developer in developers)
    {
    <li>
        @developer.Name
    </li>
    }
</ul>

@code {
    private List<Developer> developers { get; set; }
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        developers = await _developerService.GetDevelopers();
    }
}
```
## Components
Razor components are re-usable elements you can use anywhere in your application.

Your components should be created in the `Pages/Shared` directory.

### Creating Razor Components
To create a new Razor component, simply run the Spark make component command.

```bash
spark make component SomeComponent
```
A new Razor component named `SomeComponent.razor` will be created in the `Pages/Shared` directory.

### Props
TODO

### Child Content
TODO

## Pages
Your Blazor pages should be created in the `Pages` directory.

A Blazor page is a Razor component with a `@page "/some-url"` attribute at the top that represents the url it's located at.

### Creating Blazor Pages
To create a new Blazor page, simply run the Spark make page command.

```bash
spark make page Users/Index
```

A new Blazor Page named `Index.razor` will be created in the `Pages/Users` directory.

### Route Parameters
The Blazor router uses route parameters to populate corresponding component parameters with the same name. Route parameter names are case insensitive.

```razor
@page "/developers/{Id:int}"

@if (developer != null) {
    <h1>@developer.Name</h1>
}

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public int Id { get; set; }
	private Developer developer { get; set; }
    
	protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
	{
		developer = await _developerService.Get(Id);
	}
}
```

### Page title and metadata
You can set a Blazor pages `<title>` element by using the `PageTitle` component.
```razor
@page "/developers"

<PageTitle>This is the developers page</PageTitle>
```

To set metadata, like the pages description, use the `HeadContent` component.
```razor
@page "/developers"

<PageTitle>This is the developers page</PageTitle>
<HeadContent>
    <meta name="description" content="This is a page that shows all the developers.">
</HeadContent>
```

### Navigation
Blazor pages use standard html anchor elements to navigate to other Blazor pages.
```razor
@page "/developers"

<a href="/">Go to home page</a>
```

### Authentication
To read about how to authenticate and access User data from your Razor components and pages, check out Spark's [Authentication guide](/docs/authentication).

## Layouts
Layout files define a top level template for pages in Blazor Spark apps.

Spark projects come with a MainLayout.razor file setup for you already in the `Pages/Shared` directory. All pages will use this layout by default.

### Creating Layouts
To create your own layout file, add a new razor component to the `Pages/Shared` directory. For example, `Pages/Shared/NewLayout.razor`.

Layout files need to have an `@Body` tag to let Blazor know where to render the pages content.
```razor
@* Pages/Shared/NewLayout.razor *@
@inherits LayoutComponentBase

<Header />

<main class="container">
    @Body
</main>

<Footer />

```

To use the new layout on a page, add the `@layout` attribute.
```razor
@page "/developers"
@layout NewLayout

<h2>Episodes</h2>
```

## Component Naming Conventions
Blazor Spark has conventions you should follow when creating your Razor components.

### File names
Most applications have standard CRUD pages for resources.

For instance, if you app stored developers in the database, your CRUD pages should be setup like the this:
- **Pages/Developers/Index.razor** (show all developers)
- **Pages/Developers/Show.razor** (show 1 developer)
- **Pages/Developers/Create.razor** (create a developer)
- **Pages/Developers/Delete.razor** (delete 1 developer)
- **Pages/Developers/Edit.razor** (edit 1 developer)

Razor components files should also use **PascalCase** naming.

### Route names
When setting your `@page` attribute in a Blazor page, the following conventions should be followed:

**1.** Use lower case kebab case. Ex. `@page "/users/show-me-a-user"`

**2.** Use plural names. Ex. `@page "/users"`

**3.** CRUD routes should follow this naming convention:

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Index` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users"`

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Show` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/{id}"`

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Create` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/create"`

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Delete` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/delete/{id}"`

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Edit` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/edit/{id}"`

>
> If you use the Spark CLI commands to create your Pages and Components, all of the route naming conventions will automatically be setup for you.

## Assets

### CSS
Blazor Spark projects come with Tailwind CSS by default. You can learn more about Tailwind [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).

When creating a new Spark project, you can use other CSS frameworks by passing the `--css` option when running the `spark new [projectName]` command.
```bash
spark new MyApp --css bootstrap
```

### CSS Framework Options

**Tailwind CSS**
```bash
spark new MyApp --css tailwind
```

**Bootstrap CSS**
```bash
spark new MyApp --css bootstrap
```

**Pico CSS**
```bash
spark new MyApp --css pico
```

### Javascript
Blazor Spark project come with AlpineJS by default. 

AlpineJS is a javascript library that helps you create simple page interactions like mobile menus and toggling elements.

You can learn more about Alpine [here](https://alpinejs.dev/).
