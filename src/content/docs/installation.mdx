# Installation

> Blazor Spark is still in very early development. Lots will change. Please use at your own risk in production.

## What is Blazor Spark?
Blazor Spark is an all-in-one web application framework for building fast, reliable monolithic web apps.

.NET has great tooling. But it is all a bit scattered and in some cases, clunky. Blazor Spark is a web framework that takes .NET's web ecosystem and sands down the rough edges, creating an enjoyable developer experience and easily maintanable code.

## Your First Spark Project
Before creating your first spark project, you should ensure that your local machine has:

- **.NET 7 or greater** installed. You can find the download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).
- **NodeJS (16+). You can find the download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

After you have installed .NET, you will need to install the Spark console tool.
```bash
dotnet tool install --global BlazorSpark.Console
spark install
```

You are now ready to create your first Spark project!
```bash
spark new MyApp
```

After the project has been created, you can create and run the migrations for the user tables.
```bash
cd MyApp
spark make:migration User
spark run:migration
```

Finally, start .NET's local development server using the dotnet watch command:
```bash
dotnet watch
```
