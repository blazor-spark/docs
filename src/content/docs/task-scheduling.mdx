# Task Scheduling
Configuring a cron job or windows task is common for web apps. Blazor Spark utilizes Coravel's [scheduler](https://docs.coravel.net/Scheduler/) to accomplish this.

## Creating Tasks
To create a new task, simply run the Spark  `make task` command.

```bash
spark make task ExampleTask
```

A new task will be create in the `Application/Tasks` directory.

## Registering Scheduled Tasks
All scheduled tasks must be registered in the `\Application\Startup\Scheduler.cs` class.
```csharp
public static IServiceProvider RegisterScheduledJobs(this IServiceProvider services)
{
    services.UseScheduler(scheduler =>
    {
        scheduler
            .Schedule<ExampleTask>()
            .EveryFiveMinutes();
    });
    return services;
}
```

## Scheduling Tasks
More documentation coming soon. In the meantime, read about Coravels Scheduling [here](https://docs.coravel.net/Scheduler/).
