# Directory Structure

The default Blazor Spark application structure is setup to give a great starting point for your web application. 
Most of the structure will look familar to you as it follows standard conventions for Blazor applications with some new Spark directories sprinkled in.

## Application
The `Application` directory contains the core code of you application. 

### Database
The `Database` directory contains your `DbContext` and `Migrations` for EF Core.

### Events
The `Events` directory contains your event and listener classes. Events are used to alert other parts of your app that a given action has occurred. This provides great flexibility and decoupling.

### Models
The `Models` directory contains your efcore model classes and the db context. Each database table for your application has a corresponding Model class that efcore will use to interact with that table.

### Services
The `Services` directory contains your services that can be Dependency Injected on startup. Services are typically used to abstract away business logic or database calls.

### Startup
> Work in progress

The `Startup` directory contains the AppServiceRegistration class. This class is where you can add any services, events, or tasks you wrote to the DI container. It also adds the internal Spark services to the DI container.

### Tasks
The `Tasks` directory contains queueable jobs for your application. Tasks can be scheduled or added to a background queue.

## Pages
The `Pages` directory contains your Blazor pages and components. This is where your sites frontend markdown and page logic will be contained. The inner `Shared` directory contains your re-usable Blazor components. These components can be imported into your Blazor views and keep your front-end dry.

## Resources
> Work in progress

The `Resources` directory contains your uncompiled CSS files. This is where your Tailwind base classes reside and where you can write custom CSS classes as well.

## Storage
The `Storage` directory contains your application logs if the Spark logger is setup to log to files. A new log file is created every day to reduce large single file sizes.

## wwwroot
The `wwwroot` directory contains your compiled CSS, images, and other frontend public dependancies you want to use.
