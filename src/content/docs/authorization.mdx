# Authorization
Spark utilizes role based authorization and it is already scaffolded for you.

## Role Models
Every Spark app comes with a `Role` model in the `Application/Models` directory. Roles can control what pages logged in users see. A user can be assigned a role through the `UserRole` relationship.
```csharp
public class Role : BaseModel
{
    public Role()
    {
        UserRoles = new HashSet<UserRole>();
    }

    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection<UserRole> UserRoles { get; set; }
}
```

## Using Authorization in Blazor pages
You can use roles to determine what users can access Blazor pages by using the `Authorize` attribute and passing in a custom role.
```razor
@page "/admin/dashboard"
@attribute [Authorize(Roles = CustomRoles.Admin)]
<section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto py-28 min-h-screen px-4">
    <article>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">
            Admin Dashboard
        </h1>
    </article>
</section>
```

You can also combine `<AuthorizeView>` with roles to display different content on a page based on a User's role.
```razor
@page "/admin/dashboard"
@attribute [Authorize]
<section>
    <article>
        <AuthorizeView Roles="@CustomRoles.Admin">
            <Authorized>
                <h1>
                    Admin Dashboard
                </h1>
            </Authorized>
            <NotAuthorized>
                <h1>
                    No soup for you!
                </h1>
            </NotAuthorized>
        </AuthorizeView>
    </article>
</section>
```

## Adding More Custom Roles
By default, a Spark app comes with 2 roles out of the box. `Admin` and `User`. You can add more roles in the `Application/Models/CustomRoles.cs` class.
```csharp
public static class CustomRoles
{
    public const string Admin = nameof(Admin);
    public const string User = nameof(User);
}
```
